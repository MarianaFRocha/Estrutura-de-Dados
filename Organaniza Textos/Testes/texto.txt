And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow."

Oh what a thing to've done,
And it was all yellow.

Turn into something beautiful,
Do you know?
You know I love you so,
You know I love you so.

I jumped across for you,
Oh what a thing to do.
'Cause you were all yellow,

I drew a line,

So many people telling me one way
So many people telling me to stay
Never had time to have my mind made up
Caught in a motion that I don't wanna stop
